">" = open. "/>" = closed. 
</head> = Header. 
</body> = The main contents being described. 
Common tags:  Text: "<p>", "<h1-h6>"  Section: "<div>"  Media: "<img>", "<video>"  Metadata: "<head>", "<meta>",  Links: "<a>", (short for anchor)  Forms: "<form>", "<input>", "<button>". 
Classes reference something on your style sheet. They're like name tags for specific parts of the website. "My style name is ___". 
If you want to make something bold, put <strong> </strong> on both sides. 
CSS: How we make pages pretty. It's a style sheet language (not tag-based). Based on an evolving standard. Defines the style of HTML elements. Can be nested and overwritten. House analogy: HTML: the house itself. CSS: finishes (stainless steel appliances), trim, colors, furniture arrangement, etc. (Detailed stuff). 
"Hex codes" represent colors. 
How deployment works: The files (code and assets) are packaged up. Files are sent to a server somewhere in the "cloud". Files are "hosted" on a server that anyone in the world can see. When new files are uploaded they replace the old ones.
