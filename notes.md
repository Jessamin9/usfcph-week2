Common tags:  Text: "<p>", "<h1-h6>"  Section: "<div>"  Media: "<img>", "<video>"  Metadata: "<head>", "<meta>",  Links: "<a>", (short for anchor)  Forms: "<form>", "<input>", "<button>".

CSS: How we make pages pretty. It's a style sheet language (not tag-based). Based on an evolving standard. Defines the style of HTML elements. Can be nested and overwritten. House analogy: HTML: the house itself. CSS: finishes (stainless steel appliances), trim, colors, furniture arrangement, etc. (Detailed stuff).
